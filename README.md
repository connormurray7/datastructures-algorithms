###Introduction

Collection of data structures and algorithms written in C++ and Python. 

Mainly for refreshing knowledge of data structures and algorithms by implementing them while going through The Algorithm Design Manual by *Skiena*.

### Running tests

####C++
For C++, running `make run` in `cpp/tests`. The only dependency is the C++ standard library.

####Python 
For Python it is recommended to use something like [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for testing. To install 

	pip3 install nose

Navigate to `python/tests` and run `nosetest`.
